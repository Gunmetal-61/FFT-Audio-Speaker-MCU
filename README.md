# FFT-Audio-Speaker-MCU
A custom bluetooth speaker project conceived from an FFT mini-project.  This MCU version serves as a test bed for the FPGA version.

##**As of 2021/07/02:**
**This project has a working implementation of an (FFT-powered) audio spectrum analyzer with direct input from a 3.5mm jack.  Awaiting amplifier and speaker components to begin the audible part of the project.
